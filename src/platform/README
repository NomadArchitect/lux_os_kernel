This directory is for platform-specific code. All assembly language code should go in here while still aiming to write as much as possible in a higher-level portable language. The aim is to keep as much as possible of the kernel portable and platform-independent. All the exposed functions implemented in this directory will be documented someday, as I also intend to write an ARM64 port someday, but for now x86_64 is just an easier starting point.
